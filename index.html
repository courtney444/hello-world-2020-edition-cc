	<h1>Hello World Plus With Pictures - Courtney Clem</h1>

	<img src="mycar.jpg" alt="My car" style="width:300px;">

	<p> My name is Courtney. I have a big brother named Josh, and my Dad is a fireman. Family is 
		very important to me. My brother is my best friend. He is 21 years old. I am currently 
		undecided, but I am excited to figure it out at Lewis. I truely have no clue what I want to do. 
		Everyone tells me I should do different things, but I still have no clue. For a while I wanted 
		to do hair, teaching, psychology, but these things do not seem like a good fit anymore. </p>
	<p> I hope to learn if I am interested in pursing coding further. I have been struggling a little 
		in this class, but I am not ready to give up on learning. </p>
	<p> I am interested in cars, I just recently picked up a lexus LS430. 
		I enjoy driving manual (even though my Lexus isn't) and learning more about working on cars.
		I learned how to drive manual on the cutest little miata. I eventually had to sell it, 
		but it was such a great car. I mainly like JDM cars, but I grew up with a variety of different cars.
		My dad has had many different cars as he likes to race. Another thing I like is fashion. 
		I know these are very different hobbies, but I feel like it balances my life out. </p>
